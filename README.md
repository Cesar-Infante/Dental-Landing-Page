# Landing-Page
I challenged myself to create a modern and sleek design utilizing what we learned in week 5 of my coding Bootcamp. bringing back all we learned from weeks one and two this was definitely refreshing! the mock-up was created for a dental office and demonstrates a clean, simple, and working design that any place would enjoy. take a look!
